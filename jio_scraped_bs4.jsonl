Here’s what JioTV users have to say As a retired individual who enjoys staying informed, JioTV has become my go-to for news. I find the interface very friendly and easy to navigate. What I truly appreciate is the uninterrupted viewing experience, thanks to the reliable network and the absence of annoying ads. Spending a couple of hours daily catching up on current events is now a seamless part of my routine. It's a solid service, and I happily recommend it, especially for fellow news enthusiasts! Kritartha Rajkhowa Retired Professional Coimbatore I've found JioTV to be a convenient part of my recharge bundle, and I actively started enjoying it about six months ago. I appreciate having access to a variety of content, including movies through SonyLiv. While I also explore other platforms that are part of my bundle, I've always liked watching content on JioTV. It's a good app, and I often turn to it when I'm in the mood for movies and shows. Many of my friends are already using JioTV, and I'd happily recommend it! Ajanta Bera Working Professional West Bengal I am a father of a 16-year-old son with cerebral palsy. My wife spends most of the time with him. According to her, JioTV is a great entertainment source for him. He loves to watch content from Nick and Sony channels while she can finish household chores. They have been using it since the launch and have had a positive experience, with occasional Jio network-related buffering. She has no suggestions for improvement and recommends JioTV. Just happy using it. Mukesh Sharma Working Professional Delhi I have been using the JioTV app for a long time. I enjoy its exceptional video quality on my phone screen. I am especially glued to it for watching news debates between 7 pm and 9 pm that too without buffering. As a senior citizen, I would expect more election coverage including candidate debates and easier recharge options with concessions for senior citizens. Despite this, I would rate JioTV 10 out of 10, want to start a fan club, and highly recommend it to others. Vincent Das 81-year-old Retired Professional Karnataka Since 2016, I’ve been using the JioTV app and I’m totally into it for the convenience of watching anytime, anywhere—and yes, the high-quality video on mobile is a big plus. I mostly watch Bigg Boss and cricket matches almost daily to meet my entertainment needs. It has largely replaced YouTube and Facebook in my daily viewing routine. Despite a few ads, JioTV is my go-to entertainment app for relaxation, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for entertainment on the go.
